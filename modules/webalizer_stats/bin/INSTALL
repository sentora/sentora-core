Installation instructions for The Webalizer

The Webalizer is distributed in either source or binary distributions,
and installation is different for each type.  Regardless of the type
of installation, you need to obtain and un-tar/un-zip the distribution
file somewhere.  For binary distributions, you should create a directory
somewhere and chdir to it before unpacking the file.  Source distributions
will automagically create a directory for you (webalizer-x.xx-xx).  If
you are upgrading from a previous version, check the CHANGES file, and
the README.FIRST file for important upgrade information.


For Binary distributions
------------------------

You should have all the files you need in the directory you created
when you un-tarred/un-zipped the distribution file.  The file
'webalizer' in this directory is the binary executable.  Copy this
someplace useful, like /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin.  A man page for
The Webalizer is also supplied... If desired, copy the file
'webalizer.1' to your local man directory (ie: /usr/local/man/man1).
(You may also need to run 'makeinfo' or similar)

Note: There may also be platform specific installation instructions
      and/or usage notes supplied with the binary distribution.  You
      should read them, as that will be your starting point if problems
      are encountered.  Most of the binary distributions are submitted
      by users, and I cannot support them the same way I can the
      Linux binary distribution and the source code itself.


For Source distributions
------------------------

The Webalizer requires the GD graphics library by Tom Boutell.  If
you don't already have it, go to http://www.boutell.com/gd/ and
grab a copy.


New style build:

The Webalizer source distribution now comes packaged with a GNU
autoconf 'configure' script, which should allow you to simply type:

./configure
make
make install

Normal configure options apply, type ./configure --help to get a
complete list.  A few options in particular may be useful:

--with-language=<language>

Allows you to specify the language to use.  Check the /lang directory
to see the available language choices.  As an example, you could use

./configure --with-language=french

to compile the program using french (webalizer_lang.french) for output.
You can also use the --without-language switch, which will use the
default language (english).

--with-gdlib=<path-to-gd-library>
--with-gd=<path-to-gd-headers>

The configure script will attempt to locate the gd library and header
files in some of the more usual places, and should find them in most
cases.  If you have the files someplace unusual, you can specify
additional locations to look for them with this option.  (If you are
compiling gd in your home directory, and don't want to or can't put
them in the normal system places, create a directory under the webalizer
named 'gd' or 'gd1.3' for it and the script should find it without
problems or extra command line switches).

--enable-dns

DNS lookup features are added.  This simply adds the -DUSE_DNS compiler
switch.  Several dependencies are present when using the DNS code,
which is why it must be enabled manually.  If you system supports the
DNS functionality, great.. if not, don't enable it.

Some systems may require unusual settings that the configure script
cannot determine.  You can pass values to the script by setting
environment variables.  For example:

CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O LIBS=-lposix ./configure --with-language=german

Would allow you to set the compiler (c89) and various flags and
libraries to use, which would then be passed to the configure script
and eventually to the Makefile generated.  It also will cause the
program to be compiled using German instead of the English default.

If the configure script doesn't work for you.. please let me know
(along with relevant info like system type, compiler, etc..)  If you
are able and can tweek something to make it work, let me know as well.


Old style build:

If you have a platform that the configure script won't work on, or
some other situation where you have to configure and build the
source yourself,  the file 'Makefile.std' is a "stock" Makefile
that you can use to build the Webalizer.  Copy or rename the file
to 'Makefile', edit to match your system, and do the usual 'make'.
If everything seems to have gone well, next type 'make install'.

This will install the Webalizer on your system, and put a sample
configuration file in /etc (named 'webalizer.conf.sample').  If
you don't want to use the 'make install' method... just copy the
file 'webalizer' to someplace usefull and you are ready to go :)

Makefile.std works on a stock slackware 3.6 linux system. YMMV.


Usage
-----

When run, The Webalizer will read the specified log file and
produce HTML output in the directory specified (or current
directory if none).  You may specify various configuration
options either on the command line or in a configuration file.
The format of the command line is:

webalizer [options] [log_file]

Where 'options' may be any of the valid command line options
described in the README file.  If a log filename is not given,
input is taken from stdin.  A typical command line might look
something similar to:

webalizer /var/lib/httpd/logs/access_log

This will produce output in the current directory based on the
logfile /var/lib/httpd/logs/access_log.  Another example:

webalizer -c somehost.conf

This will read the configuration file somehost.conf, which
should specify, among other things, the log filename and
output directory to use.  You can use 'webalizer -h' to get
a list of available command line options, or view the file
README for complete instructions on all available configuration
options.  You should note that The Webalizer will _always_
look for a configuration file named 'webalizer.conf' in either
the current directory or in /etc/, and will process that file
_before_ any other configuration or command line options.  If
you run a single server, you may want to create a default
configuration file and place it in the /etc/ directory.  This
will allow you to simply type 'webalizer' without the need to
specify additional command line options.


Configuration
-------------

The Webalizer can be customized in many ways using either the
command line or configuration files.  To test The Webalizer,
type: 'webalizer /var/lib/httpd/logs/access_log', changing the
directory to wherever your log files are.  After processing,
you should have the output and a file named index.html which
can be viewed with any browser.  The Webalizer can accept many
command line options as well, type 'webalizer -h' to view them.
In addition to the command line options, The Webalizer can
be customized using configuration files. There is a sample.conf
file that is part of both the source and binary distributions
that can be used as a 'template' for creating your own site
configuration file.  Just make a copy of the file and name it
something like 'mysite.conf'.  Edit the new file to match your
particular setup and taste.

To test the new configuration file, type 'webalizer -c mysite.conf'
(or whatever your configuration file is named).  Fire up the
browser and look at the results.  If you rename your new
configuration file to 'webalizer.conf', you will only need
to type 'webalizer', and The Webalizer will use it as the
default.  See the README file for more on configuation and
use of configuation files.


Language Support
----------------

Language support is provided as language specific header
files that must be compiled into the program.  If you don't
have the source code, get it.  If you can't compile the
program yourself, ask a friend.  The /lang/ directory of
the distribution contains all supported languages at the
time of release.  Additional/updated language files will
be found at ftp://ftp.mrunix.net/pub/webalizer/lang and
are always the most current versions.

To build with language support, use the --with-language
option of the configure script.  This will automagically
do for you the steps described below.  If you can't use
the configure script, you can manually select the language
file to use.

In the webalizer source directory, you will find a symbolic
link for the file webalizer_lang.h, and it will be pointing
to the file webalizer_lang.english which is the default.
Delete the link (ie: rm webalizer_lang.h) and create a new
one to the language file you want The Webalizer to use
(ie: ln -s lang/webalizer_lang.spanish webalizer_lang.h)
and re-compile the program.

Note: The source distribution of The Webalizer contains all
      language support files that were available at the time.
      Additional/updated language files can be found at:
      ftp://ftp.mrunix.net/pub/webalizer/lang where I will put
      them as I receive them.


Common Questions
----------------

Q: Will it run on [some platform]
A: If it is a *nix platform, it should without a problem.  If it's
   something different, probably not and your on your own if you
   want to try to make it work.

Q: When I compile, I get "file not found" errors?
A: Most likely, the compiler cant find the header files for the
   GD Graphics library.  If they are someplace other than the
   default /usr/local/include/gd, then you need to change the
   GDLIB variable in the Makefile to point to the proper place.

Q: I get "libgd not found' errors?
A: You don't have the GD graphics located in a standard library
   path, or you don't have the GD graphics library at all.  If
   the later, go to http://www.boutell.com/gd/ and grab a copy.
   If you do have it, add a -L switch in the Makefile to point
   to the proper location.

Q: I can't get the GD graphics library to compile?
A: The GD Library was written (and hopefully maintained) by
   Tom Boutell, not me.  Visit his web site, ask him a
   question or hit one of the newsgroups...  I can't help you
   out too much with this one.
